title: "Guide: Adding support for a new tablet"
---

## Prelude

This guide will step you through how to make a configuration for a tablet. Some
tablets can take a few minutes to set up, while others can require analyzing
the USB packets sent by the manufacturers tablet driver among other things.

It is probably worthwhile to keep the [Tablet configuration reference] open in
another tab. This guide will assume that you are aware of the details provided
on that page.

[Tablet configuration reference]: {% link _wiki/Development/Configurations.md %}

## Preparing your system for adding support

It is highly recommended to remove (or unload) your existing tablet drivers
before proceeding.

### Uninstalling drivers on Windows

Tablet drivers are often automatically installed by Windows.

Running [TabletDriverCleanup] is the easiest way to ensure that
OpenTabletDriver has access to the tablet.

[TabletDriverCleanup]: {{ site.data.links.external.TabletDriverCleanup.latest }}

### Unloading drivers on Linux

If you've installed OpenTabletDriver from an official package, the stock tablet
drivers are already blacklisted.

Still, run the following command to ensure that the upstream drivers are unloaded:

```sh
sudo rmmod hid_uclogic wacom 2>/dev/null
```

You likely need to set up udev rules so that your user can access the raw
device directly.

Normally, this is autogenerated by the build process and uses the officially
supported configs.

You can define these manually for now, and put them in a local udev rule file,
e.g. `/etc/udev/rules.d/91-opentabletdriver-adds.rules`:

```conf
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="b33f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="c4k3", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="b33f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="c4k3", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl"
```

Make sure to change the values of `idVendor` and `idProduct` as appropriate.
You can get them with `lsusb`.

> Note: `idVendor` and `idProduct` must be in base-16 (hexadecimal) as opposed
  to the base-10 format used in OpenTabletDriver configurations.

See `man 7 udev` for systemd udev syntax. If you're not using systemd udev, see
your distro documentation, or change the appropriate usb and hidraw permissions
manually.

### MacOS

TODO, probably just uninstall existing drivers?

## Configuration Template

Getting a configuration template is usually simple if OpenTabletDriver supports
other tablets from your manufacturer, especially if it's in the same line of
models.

- Copy a "neighbouring" configuration from the
  `OpenTabletDriver.Configurations/Configurations/` folder
- Rename the file to be `<model name>.json`, e.g. `H420.json`

If your manufacturer does not have an existing template, please use the
[Configuration skeleton] or copy any other tablet configuration and follow the
guide carefully.

> Note that the configuration format between OpenTabletDriver 0.6 (`0.6.x`) and
  0.7 (`master`) differs slightly. Make sure that you pick a configuration of
  the same format as the version of OpenTabletDriver you're using.

[Configuration skeleton]: https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/issues/3249

## Setting specifications according to official manufacturer specifications

Setting up some of the specifications now can simplify touching up later values
if you know what they are. You can also add them as you discover the feature;
we will ensure the specifications are set correctly at the end of the guide.

Some (almost) always correct values include:
- Pen and tablet (aux) button counts
- Tool support (such as tablet mouse)
- Touch support
- Pen pressure range

Digitizer dimensions (for both pen and touch digitizer) will be determined as a
later part of the guide, and are not always correct.

Note that wheels (rings) are not yet supported, and should not be directly defined
(even as a button). See [OpenTabletDriver#1367] for more information

[OpenTabletDriver#1367]: https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/issues/1367

## Configuring the digitizer identifier

Configuring a correct digitizer identifier is the bread and butter of tablet
detection. This section covers how to set all the identifier fields
appropriately.

A single tablet model generally only needs a single identifier. Still, firmware
variants for an otherwise identical tablet can cause tablets to need more than
1 identifier to correctly identify variants.

Therefore, it is important to make your identifier as relaxed as possible while
still being strict enough to not cause identifier conflicts with other
configurations.

Detection, in broad terms, checks in the following order:

1. Match VendorID and ProductID
2. If not null, match InputReportLength and OutputReportLength
  - This helps select a specific interface of the tablet
3. If not null, match DeviceStrings
  - This helps differentiate between firmwares

There is more to detection than this (such as attributes), but 99.9% of use
cases can be covered with the above.

### ID's and report lengths

At the very minimum, your configuration should have a non-null `VendorID` and `ProductID`.

If your tablet has multiple interfaces, it is very likely only 1 of them
contains the tablet data stream. This is where `InputReportLength` and
`OutputReportLength` comes in.

Even if your tablet only has a single interface, it is often a good idea to
specify at least one of the lengths as non-zero, and only define them as `null`
if you know what you're doing

> If you specify report lengths as null, it can be hard to fix any future
  conflicts that may arise without knowing what values your specific tablet
  has. If you do decide to specify them as null, please make sure to include a
  OpenTabletDriver diagnostics with the pull request, or include the lengths in
  the commit description.

### Picking the Parser {#parser}

Picking the parser is the most important part of ensuring your tablet functions
correctly. Picking the wrong parser can result in missing or (sometimes subtly)
broken features.

You must use a class which implements the `Parse(byte[])` function.

How to write a parser from scratch is out of scope of this guide, but if you
find that a parser you're using needs a code change to work, it is usually a
better idea to make a new parser that builds off it instead.

To see which functionality is supported by a parser, please see the code for
the parsers return paths in its `Parse(byte[])` function. An example is
provided below.

#### `XP_PenReportParser` example

At the time of this writing, [`XP_PenReportParser`] can return 5 different
types of reports (not in order)

[`XP_PenReportParser`]: https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/blob/f14a184fef67a52637ab494497a151044bafd553/OpenTabletDriver.Configurations/Parsers/XP_Pen/XP_PenReportParser.cs#L7-L21

##### `OutOfRangeReport`

Fairly selfdescript, it doesn't actually report any specific values to the
OS but rather 'resets' the pen out.

##### `XP_PenAuxReport`:

Reports `IAuxReport`, an aux-buttons-only report, ie. no position coordinates.

##### `XP_PenTabletReport`

Reports the following reports:

- `ITabletReport`
  - The pen's pressure
  - Pen buttons
  - It is an `IAbsolutePositionReport` that also reports the following:
    - The 2-point vector of the pen
- `ITiltReport`
  - The 2-point vector of the pen's tilt
- `IEraserReport`
  - Whether the eraser is active or not

##### `XP_PenTabletOverflowReport`

An almost identical version of the above `XP_PenTabletReport` except with
larger ranges for the position coordinate and the data structure adjusted
accordingly.

##### `TabletReport`

A barebones tablet report that only reports an `ITabletReport`

### Init strings (Feature/OutputInitReport, InitializationStrings)

These are almost always necessary to use to bring the tablet out of HID mode
and into a more preferred mode, e.g. vendor mode.

Vendor mode is the mode used by the official drivers, and allows
OpenTabletDriver to support all of the tablets features, assuming the parser
supports it.

Getting these can be achieved in 2 ways:

#### Guessing

Copying the appropriate init strings from a sibling configuration is usually
adequate.

#### USB Packet capture

This is usually done with Wireshark (and winpcap). A guide on this is planned
but not in progress. See [opentabletdriver.github.io#171] for more information.

[opentabletdriver.github.io#171]: https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/opentabletdriver.github.io/issues/171

### Device strings

In some cases, vendors (especially Huion) might release a tablet with different
specifications that otherwise has the same ID's as another released tablet.

While this complicates things, we have another tool in our arsenal called
device strings descriptors.

The configuration format is a dictionary where the key matches the descriptor
ID (up to 255) and the value is a regex that the string descriptor's value must
match with.

## Validating values

Assuming you now have a configuration that correctly identifies your tablet,
you now have to validate that you're using the correct parser and then the
correct configuration values.

### Validating the parser

This section is **not** for making sure the specifications in the configuration
is configured correctly, only the parser.

The values below can be validated from entirely within the tablet debugger.

The tablet debugger will show the values as parsed directly from the tablet,
before any configuration adjustments (such as button count) take place.

If any of the values seems absent or malfunctioning, you are probably
using the wrong parser.

#### Digitizer {#validate-parser-digitizer}

Verify that the top left of the tablet equals to `[0, 0]` or `[1, 1]`.

Verify that the X and Y values increment monotonically. Critically, the value
must never wrap around.

#### Pen maximum pressure

Value must transition somewhat smoothly from around 0 to its maximum value.

#### All pen and auxiliary buttons

Every button click must cause a distinct state change.

Some tablets may support a separate 'unclick' report.

#### Tool identification

This is mostly a Wacom feature, and can be difficult to read manually from the
tablet debugger. Use the recording feature of the tablet debugger and read the
annotated file for tool idenfication.

Unless you have many tools at your disposal, testing the actual functionality
can be difficult. `ToolID` is the "model number" of the tool, whereas
`ToolSerial` is the, well, the serial ID of the tool.

The tool ID is used for art programs (and the operating system) to assume some
defaults. The extent of exposing tool ID correctly is not completely finished,
and is only partially supported on Linux for now.

The serial ID is very useful for artists that have multiple of the same tool so
that their art program can track per-tool settings.

#### Touch

Touch is currently not exposed to the operating system, but some parsers do
parse touch. If your tablet does parse touch, make sure that it behaves
similarly to the [pen digitizer](#validate-parser-digitizer).

See [OpenTabletDriver#1664] for more information on exposing this to the OS.

[OpenTabletDriver#1664]: https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/issues/1664

### Correctly determining digitizer dimensions

The ideal way to calculate the these values, is to first figure out the `MaxX` and
`MaxY` values of the digitizer.

You will need the following values:

- The LPMM (lines per millimeter) of the tablet for both axises (horizontal and vertical).
- The maximum reported **X** (horizontal) value of the tablet
- The maximum reported **Y** (vertical) value of the tablet

> The manufacturers digitizer dimensions can often times be slightly wrong
  (usually rounded up), so getting this right ensures that users can keep using
  the exact same tablet area between different tablets in OpenTabletDriver

#### Getting maximum X and Y values

You can get the X and Y values from OpenTabletDriver's tablet debugger.
Move your tool (e.g. pen) to the outer edges (usually right side and bottom
side) of the digitizer area while keeping an eye on the reported X and Y values
in the tablet debugger.

If your tablet is reporting very quickly, it might be worth using the tablet data recording feature.
> A way to easily display the maximum value returned is planned but not
  implemented yet. See [OpenTabletDriver#2433] for more information.

The `MaxX` and `MaxY` values should be equal to the highest observed value
reported by the tablet on each axis.

To ensure getting the highest possible X and Y values, make sure that you're
moving your tool to the edge at multiple angles.

If your achieved `MaxX` and `MaxY` values seem incorrect (such as 4096 x 4096),
you might be initializing the tablet incorrectly, or you're not using the
correct parser. See the [Parser](#parser) section for more information.

[OpenTabletDriver#2433]: https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/issues/2433

#### Getting the LPMM

This is almost always exactly 100 or exactly 200 for both axises.

> If your tablet only offers an line per inch (LPI) value, you can divide the
  LPI by `25.4` to get the LPMM.

#### Calculating the width and height

With the LPMM and maximum values reported by the tablet in hand, calculate the
width and the height using the following formulas:

```py
Width = MaxX / Horizontal_LPMM
Height = MaxY / Vertical_LPMM
```

Double check that the resulting width and height is close to the manufacturer's
specified digitizer working area.

A deviation of up to 10% is normal, but if it is obviously wrong (more than 50%
out), confirm that both your LPMM and width/height values are correct.

> If the guessed LPMM seems incorrect, it is better to manually measure the
  width and the height of the digitizers active area.

### Verify functionality

Now that you've checked the values for correctness, you now have to validate
the exposed functionality as much as possible.

You don't need to validate every single feature set in the OS. For example,
pressure is assumed working if the tablet debugger reports it correctly.

You now need to double check that the following functionality completely works:

- The entirety of the tablets area is usable
- All pen buttons works and can be assigned
- All auxiliary (tablet) buttons works and can be assigned
- Extra tool functionality, if able:
  - Tablet mouse
  - Any other tools your tablet might support

If anything is not working to your expectations, you might be using the wrong
parser, or you specified some values incorrectly.

## Fin

That's it, you've now successfully made a tablet configuration!

Now, optionally commit it with `git` and push it to your chosen branch and an open a [pull request].

## FAQ

### My cursor is going everywhere!

Make sure you've uninstalled other drivers.

If you did, and you're on Linux, your tablet might need the `libinputoverride` attribute.

### My tablet can't be that difficult to add, TL;DR?

- Copy existing config from a sibling tablet
- Adjust identifiers and confirm that the tablet debugger is doing things now
- Confirm that the parser is functioning correctly (pressure etc)
- Figure out `MaxX` and `MaxY` and `LPMM` of your tablet's digitizer.
- Adjust height and widths based off of `MaxX`, `MaxY` and their `LPMM`.
- Double check that it still works from a replug
- Double check that all the specifications are correct
  - Buttons, digitizer area, pressure, touch, etc.
- Submit pull request to the appropriate branch and pray that your configuration passes tests
  - If submitting a PR, don't forget to update `TABLETS.md` to document the support.
