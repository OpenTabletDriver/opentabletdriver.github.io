### Common Problems

If your tablet is connected properly and is supported, but is still not detected, [check logs]({% link _wiki/Documentation/Logs.md %}) for any errors or warnings. If you find any, try finding for a match and its accompanying solution below:

#### Another driver is found {#hid_uclogic}

*Symptoms*:

```otdlog
Another tablet driver found: <driver>
```

*Solution*:

- [See here]({% link _wiki/Documentation/RequiredPermissions.md %}#setup-linux)

#### Insufficient permissions {#udev}

*Symptoms*:

```otdlog
Not permitted to open HID class device at /dev/hidrawX
```

*Solution*:

- [See here]({% link _wiki/Documentation/RequiredPermissions.md %})

## Tablet is detected but not working?

### Fresh Install {#fail-virtual-device}

If this is a fresh install and you have not configured your tablet yet, [check logs]({% link _wiki/Documentation/Logs.md %}) for any errors or warnings. If you find any, try finding for a match and its accompanying solution below:

#### Missing uinput device

*Symptoms*:

```otdlog
Failed to initialize virtual tablet. (error code ENODEV)
```

*Solution*:

- Reboot your computer.

#### Missing uinput device support

*Symptoms*:

```otdlog
Failed to initialize virtual tablet. (error code ENOENT)
```

Make sure that your kernel has uinput support. If you are using a custom kernel or builds kernel from source, make sure that you have enabled `CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT` in your kernel configuration. Refer to your distro's documentation regarding kernel configuration.

#### Missing uinput device permissions

*Symptoms*:

```otdlog
Failed to initialize virtual tablet. (error code EACCES)
```

*Solution*:

- [See here]({% link _wiki/Documentation/RequiredPermissions.md %})

### Non-fresh Install

Try disabling your filters one-by-one and see if input finally works.

## Tablet is working but there is no pressure {#artist-mode}

Pressure support is available by changing the output mode of OpenTabletDriver to Artist Mode:

- Change output mode (at the bottom left of OpenTabletDriver) to <kbd>Artist Mode</kbd>.
- Remove the tip binding in the Pen Settings panel by opening the advanced binding editor (press <kbd>...</kbd> next to the binding), then press <kbd>Clear</kbd>
- Save or apply your settings, and then try drawing in an application that supports pressure.

See [here](#artist-mode-bindings) for setting up bindings for Artist Mode.

## Mouse button bindings are not working when using Artist Mode {#artist-mode-bindings}

Artist mode does not support regular mouse buttons. You will need to use artist mode pen bindings in the advanced binding editor instead of regular mouse buttons.

## How to autostart daemon on boot? {#autostart}

### systemd {#systemd-autostart}

Make sure that you have enabled the systemd service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable opentabletdriver.service --now
```

If the daemon doesn't reliably autostart on boot, then the desktop environment is not
configured correctly to integrate with systemd.

In such case, refer to your desktop environment's documentation on how to autostart processes on
login using the instructions [below](#other-inits)

### Other init systems {#other-inits}

OpenTabletDriver offers no official support for other init systems. Refer to your init system's documentation on how to autostart processes on login. The command to execute on login is:

```bash
otd-daemon
```

> This command should be run as user, not root.

## The cursor feels slow on Artist Mode {#libinput-smoothing}

Using Artist Mode will result in some minor smoothing due to libinput's tablet handling.

To disable this smoothing, add the contents below to `/etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks`:

```ini
[OpenTabletDriver Virtual Tablet]
MatchName=OpenTabletDriver*
AttrTabletSmoothing=0
```

You should restart the OpenTabletDriver daemon after updating this file.

## Can I bypass the stock tablet driver block? {#bypass-driver-block}

Yes. Use the `-i` flag when invoking `modprobe` to bypass the block. E.g.:

```sh
modprobe -i wacom
```

OpenTabletDriver uses `install /usr/bin/true` rather than `blacklist` as some
official manufacturer tablet drivers was found to not clean up properly when
uninstalled.
